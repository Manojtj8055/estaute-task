# Employee Appraisal and Bell Curve - Spring Boot Application

## Overview

This application helps to manage employee appraisals and visualize their performance using a bell curve chart. The backend is built using Spring Boot, and the frontend provides an interactive UI to display appraisal data and bell curve statistics.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure Database Credentials

- Open the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file.
- Update the following fields with your local PostgreSQL database connection details:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name
    username: your_database_username
    password: your_database_password
    driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
```



## 1. Set Up the Database

Navigate to the `src/main/resources/db/migrations/` directory.

Run the `initial_setup.sql` script on your local PostgreSQL database to create the necessary tables and insert initial data. You can execute the script using the following command:

```bash
psql -U your_database_username -d your_database_name -f src/main/resources/db/migrations/initial_setup.sql
```
